Markdown extension to include text files (preprocessor).

	- Checkout Mustache (pystache) inclusion ability.
	- Generalized commands: {command: arguments}, e.g. {include: footer.md}

	It could be a separate markdown extension:

	{include:disclaimer.inc.md} — from the document directory
	{include:@disclaimer.md} — from the preconfigured path
	{include:footnotes.txt} — include plain text (include during postprocessing)

	Simple syntax:

	{{ fragment.txt }}

	To prevent fragments compillation as a separate pages, use '_' prefix. File name pattern could be configured with regex.
