# Assets Directory

This directory is dedicated for stylesheets, JavaScript files and other static content.

To override standard theme stylesheets, create 'css/custom.css' file in this directory (full path in the website tree should be 'assets/css/custom.css'). This file will be automatically included to templates.

 To override standard favicon, create a file named 'favicon.ico' in this directory.
